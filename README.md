##This is my Vim Configuration
There are many like it. But this one is mine.

It could be cleaned up quite a bit and could take better advantage Bundle/Vundle. 
But it isn't and it doesn't.

##Installation
Compile vim with Python 2.x support (Required for YCM)

clone this repo

./write.sh (this will overwite ~/.vimrc and ~/.vim/)

:BundleInstall

cd into YCM dir and ./install.sh (required cmake)

##Other dot files
  This repo also contains a few other dot files including a bash and tmux configuration. These are not copied over via write.sh
